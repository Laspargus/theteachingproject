# The Teaching Project

This app is our second project made during THP_Next, a bootcamp that aims to train future professional web developers.
Our app helps teachers to manage and organize their classes by creating new courses and inviting students to join theses courses. The app has a back-end made with a Rails API 💎 and a front-end in React.js ⚛️.
